              <p>My goal and role will be to support you through your journey and in my opinion most importantly, give you the 
                knowledge on nutrition, diet, calories and exercise so you can continue to see results long after you will need me.
                One quote I stand by is ”Give someone a fish they will eat for a day, teach someone how to fish and they will eat for a lifetime”.
                So any questions you may have please don’t hesitate to ask and I will get back to you as soon as possible.
              </p>

              <h3 class="subtitle-box">SOME PAPERWORK</h3>
              <p>There is a link at the end with a Health Screening Form, it is important that you complete this before we begin as i will need to have knowledge on your medical history, injuries, conditions and activity levels before i design a programme and diet to help YOU specifically to achieve YOUR goals.</p>
              <p><i>NOTE:</i> Please allow up to 5 working days to design your training and nutrition plan as it will be personalised to you.</p>
